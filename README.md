Since I was little, I have decided to be a barrister and protect justice for the world. Laws are everywhere in the world. You’d not find a place on earth where laws don’t exist. It may not be the same, everywhere on earth, but everyone has the same goal -- bringing order and justice to the world.  My nickname is  ‘Justice Walker’ as spreading justice will be the path I walk. I am good at criminal psychology, which I can properly use during my career.  My favorite genres are mystery and detective stories and movies. I hope my legal advice will help you in your time of need, as that is my aim. It’s my pleasure to help you.
